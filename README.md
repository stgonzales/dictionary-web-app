## My process

### Built with

- [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/) - Simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project I was able to understand some of the concepts of [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/) - how to create and use context, how to use signals and [Solijs helper components](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#control-flow), also traing more about [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) dark mode.
